# JS-Playground

This project is made to quickly smash some testing JavaScript environment to play around with some brand new framework (because this one that came out week ago is already outdated). There is an easy `build` script to generate production version of your app as well. Have fun :)

## How?

```
git clone git@github.com:pawelgrzybek/JS-Playground.git
cd JS-Playground
```
then

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

or :)

```bash
yarn
yarn run dev
```

when it is finished...

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn run build
```
